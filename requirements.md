You are given an array of integers of size N. Can you find the sum of the elements in the array?

# Input

The first line of input consists of an integer NN. The next line contains NN space-separated integers representing the array elements.

###Sample:

`6`

`1 2 3 4 10 11`

# Output

Output a single value equal to the sum of the elements in the array.

For the sample above you would just print 3131 since

`1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 11 = 31.`
